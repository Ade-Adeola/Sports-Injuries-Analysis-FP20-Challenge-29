Sports Injuries Analysis — FP20 Challenge 29

Overview

This project analyzes 15,000+ recorded sports injuries to uncover patterns, risk factors, recovery trends, and cost drivers.
The goal is to answer 14 key research questions and provide actionable recommendations for reducing injuries and improving athlete health.

⸻

Dataset Summary
	•	Total injuries: 15,000
	•	Total recoveries: 14,773 (11,856 fully recovered)
	•	Average recovery time: 49 days
	•	Recurrence rate: 19.83%
	•	Total cost: €27.70M

Key Questions & Findings

1. Which injuries occur most frequently?
	•	Fractures (2,043 cases) → most common
	•	Muscle strains and tendon injuries follow
	•	Rib injuries → rarest (514 cases)

2. Which sports/events have the highest injury rates?
	•	Athletics → 3,041 cases
	•	Competition events → 5,101 injuries
	•	Tennis → safest sport (2,946 cases)

3 & 8. Which treatments speed up recovery?
	•	Rest → shortest recovery (47 days)
	•	Massage, medication, physiotherapy → 50–51 days

4. Are injuries more common in certain age/gender groups?
	•	Female athletes → 65.52% of injuries
	•	Women 31–35 → highest female injury rate
	•	Men 16–20 → highest male injury rate

5. How does severity vary across sports?
	•	Boxing → highest share of severe injuries

6 & 10. Do coaching/training loads affect recovery?
	•	Teams with structured prevention have recurrence rates <15% vs dataset average 19.83%

7. How long does recovery take per injury type?
	•	Achilles injuries → longest recovery (54 days)

9. Regional differences?
	•	UK → highest recurrence (21.94%)
	•	Austria → fewest injuries (949 cases)

11. Does surface/competition level matter?
	•	Indoor courts → highest injuries (2,792)
	•	Clay courts → lowest injuries (704)

12. Cost patterns?
	•	Fractures → €3.6M in costs (highest)
	•	2022–2023 → costliest season (€9.37M)

⸻

KPIs
	•	Total injuries
	•	Total recoveries & full recoveries
	•	Average recovery days
	•	Recurrence rate
	•	Total cost & cost per injury type
	•	Peak injury month/season
	•	Injury frequency by sport, event, surface, gender, and age group
	•	Treatment effectiveness

⸻

Recommendations
	1.	Build rest periods into athlete schedules to prevent overuse.
	2.	Target high-cost, long-recovery injuries like fractures and Achilles injuries.
	3.	Develop gender- and age-specific prevention programs.
	4.	Reduce recurrence rates through targeted rehab and workload management.
	5.	Explore safer playing surfaces to reduce injury occurrence.
